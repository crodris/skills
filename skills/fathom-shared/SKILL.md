description: Internal shared contracts for the Fathom execute and scaffold skills. Never invoke this directly; it holds the tracker, memory, approval, and convention reference files those skills read at runtime. It exists as a skill only so installers that copy skill directories carry these files alongside execute and scaffold.

# Fathom shared contracts

This directory is not an invocable skill.
It holds the contract files the `execute` and `scaffold` skills read before doing any tracker or memory work: `trackers.md`, `memory.md`, `agents.md`, `conventions.md`, `approval.md`, and the per-tracker and per-backend adapter files under `trackers/` and `memory/`.

If an agent invoked this by mistake, stop here and do nothing; the real entry points are the `execute` and `scaffold` skills, which reference these files as `../fathom-shared/<file>.md`.
