# ship pipeline profile

This repository's resolved delivery pipeline, read by the `ship` skill before it
touches the working tree. Edit it directly; ship rewrites it only when one of
these commands stops resolving.

```markdown
verify: bin/test-worktree-setup.sh && bin/test-scan-skills.sh && bin/scan-skills.sh && bin/sync-versions.sh && bin/test-check-dashes.sh && bin/check-dashes.sh && claude plugin validate --strict .   # asked
base: main
release: none
post-merge: none
```

Detection alone would find only `bin/scan-skills.sh`, because that is the sole
command the README names as a pre-commit gate. `bin/sync-versions.sh` is just as
much a gate - it fails when a skill directory is claimed by no plugin entry, by
more than one, or is claimed but missing - so it is recorded here rather than
left to be rediscovered. `claude plugin validate --strict .` gates
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and CI runs it in `plugin-validate.yml`.
`bin/check-dashes.sh` bans em and en dashes, with its scope in the README, and
`bin/test-check-dashes.sh` proves it; CI runs both in `prose.yml`.
