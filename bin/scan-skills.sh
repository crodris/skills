# Scan the skills under skills/ with NVIDIA SkillSpector and fail on any
# non-suppressed finding.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/scan-skills.sh [skill ...]   # default: every skills/<name>/ with a SKILL.md
#
# Environment:
#   SKILLSPECTOR_LLM=1   also run the LLM semantic stage (requires provider credentials,
#                        e.g. SKILLSPECTOR_PROVIDER=anthropic + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
#   REPORT_DIR=<dir>     write per-skill JSON and Markdown reports into <dir>
#
# Known false positives are suppressed via the repo-root .skillspector-baseline.yaml,
# with an auditable reason per suppression. Suppressed findings still appear in the
# JSON reports under "suppressed".
#
# Each skill is scanned exactly once; the Markdown report is rendered from that
# scan's JSON so the report can never disagree with the verdict that gated CI.
